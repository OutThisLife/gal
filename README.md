# gal
Inspired by [git-push-all](https://github.com/ssmolkin1/git-push-all), I made this to get rid of some errors and simplify to just adding and pushing.

## Usage
Install via `npm i -g gal` or `yarn global add gal` and then use it like so:

### git push
```
> gal
```

### git pull
```
> gal pull
```

### git add, commit, push
```
> gal "my commit message"
```
